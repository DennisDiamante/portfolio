			Dennis C. Diamante will be one of the best full stack developer in the Philippines by 2020.	Without basic knowledge on programming, he enrolled himself into a 6-month web development training. With the never ending help and support from the instructors and his co-trainees, he finished the training in Top 3. He pursued his passion on web development since then. His goal is to be on top of the industry.
